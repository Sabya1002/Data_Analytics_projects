# Walmart Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing data analysis on Walmart's sales data using Python. The main objective is to extract meaningful insights from three CSV files: `train_walmart.csv`, `stores.csv`, and `features.csv`. The Jupyter Notebook file named `walmart_analysis.ipynb` contains the code and analysis for this project.

## Files

1. **walmart_analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code for data analysis. It is structured with sections and comments to make the code easily understandable. The notebook walks through the data analysis process step by step, from data loading to exploration, cleaning, and visualization.

2. **train_walmart.csv**: This CSV file contains historical sales data for various departments in Walmart stores. It includes information such as store and department details, weekly sales, and other relevant metrics.

3. **stores.csv**: This CSV file contains additional information about the Walmart stores, including their sizes and types.

4. **features.csv**: This CSV file contains additional features and information related to the Walmart stores, including details about the holiday weeks.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
 pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
 
##  Usage
Download the Jupyter Notebook file walmart_analysis.ipynb and the CSV files (train_walmart.csv, stores.csv, features.csv).
Open the Jupyter Notebook using a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and generate the analysis.
Results
The notebook will generate visualizations and insights regarding Walmart's sales data, providing a better understanding of the trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales.

## Notes
Ensure that the CSV files are in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file to facilitate seamless data loading.
Feel free to modify the code and analysis based on your specific requirements.
